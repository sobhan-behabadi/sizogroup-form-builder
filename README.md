## Available Props

The `Fields` type supports the following properties:

- `type`: `"text" | "password" | "textarea" | "radio" | "checkbox" | "switch" | "select"`
- Note: When you specify one of these type values in a field object, TypeScript automatically infers the field type and provides autocompletion for the allowed properties. For example, setting type: "select" will suggest options and selectionMode, while type: "checkbox" will suggest title and dir.
- `name`: string (required, unique identifier for the field)
- `label?`: string (optional label for the field)
- `initialValue?`: any (default value for the field)
- `rules?`: `RegisterOptions` (validation rules from react-hook-form)
- `options?`: `{ label: string; value: string }[]` (for select and radio)
- `selectionMode?`: `"single" | "multiple"` (for select)
- `color?`: `"primary" | "secondary" | "warning" | "danger" | "default"`
- `radius?`: `"none" | "sm" | "md" | "lg" | "full"`
- `variant?`: `"flat" | "bordered" | "faded"`
- `labelPlacement?`: `"inside" | "outside"`
- `orientation?`: `"horizontal" | "vertical"` (for radio)
- `title?`: string (for checkbox and switch)
- `dir?`: `"ltr" | "rtl"`
